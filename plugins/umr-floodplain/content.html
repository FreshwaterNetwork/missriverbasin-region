	<h3 class="umrH1">Identify Floodplain Units</h3>
	<div class="explainWrap" style="display:block;">
		<p>The Floodplain Explorer enables you to see the multiple benefits that functioning floodplains provide to nature and people. To show you this, we’ve integrated information including comprehensive datasets and modeling results related to these benefits (e.g. flood protection, water quality, and habitat) to identify opportunities for potential floodplain conservation, restoration and reconnection.</p>
		<h4>Flood Frequency</h4>
		<p>Flood frequency is the annual probability that a flood event will occur. The Floodplain Explorer contains data that delineate floodplains for two different flood frequencies – the 20% and 1% flood frequency events. 20% is the probability each year that a flood of this size will occur, which means that on average this flood event is expected to occur once every 5 years. The 1% event has a 1% chance of occurring each year, or on average would be expected to occur once every 100 years. This event is the so-called “100-year flood” and is the flood frequency that is used to define the regulatory flood map, or the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) and demarcates areas within which property owners are required to purchase flood insurance.</p>
		<h4>Floodplains By Watershed</h4>
		<p>The Floodplain Explorer allows you to view floodplain units that are the intersection between floodplains (either the 1% or the 20% chance events) and their contributing watersheds (either HUC-10 or HUC-12). To do this, we have summarized related floodplain attribute data in two different watershed units to offer you flexibility in viewing the data and identifying management opportunity areas. HUC-12s are the smallest size watershed delineated by the USGS and range from 10,000 - 40,000 acres. HUC-10s are the next larger watersheds, ranging from 40,000 – 250,000 acres.</p>		
		<h4>Management Actions</h4>
		<p>The Floodplain Explorer offers you the option of selecting three different management actions and viewing data relevant to each.</p>
		<p>1. Conservation -  View data related to conservation of currently unprotected natural lands in the floodplain that are not disconnected from the river channel. This management action targets lands that may be subject to potential future development or conversion to agriculture. These areas may already be providing important floodplain benefits so may not offer significant additional benefits (e.g., nutrient reduction). However, conservation action in these areas could avoid potential future conversion or degradation. This management action would protect the important services that these lands are already providing.</p>
		<p>2. Restoration - View data associated with areas currently in agriculture yet not behind known/mapped levees. This management action would focus on restoring natural vegetation (i.e., reforestation) and potentially addressing artificial drainage (surface and subsurface) or other hydrologic issues caused by converting floodplain to agriculture. However, because the areas are not disconnected from a river by levees, actions would not address reconnection. Restoring floodplain habitat on these lands will provide increased biodiversity benefits, and hydrology restoration on these lands may provide an increase in other services like nutrient reduction.</p>
		<p>3. Reconnection - View data related to restoration of areas currently disconnected by levees mapped in the National Levee Dataset. This is the most complex management action. Like the restoration action, it would likely require focus on restoring natural vegetation (i.e., reforestation) and potentially addressing artificial drainage. However, the defining characteristic of this management action is addressing features like levees to reconnect these lands with a river. These lands may offer the greatest increase in nutrient reduction and other floodplain benefits but also would likely require the greatest investment to address vegetative restoration, hydrologic restoration, and reconnection between the river channel and the floodplain.

		<h4>Land Use Characteristics</h4>
		<p>We used the National Land Cover Dataset and the Cropland Data Layer to classify all the lands in the 20% and 1% flood frequency categories, distinguishing between lands in agriculture, developed areas, and lands in a natural land cover type.</p>
		<h4>Water Quality Benefits</h4>
		<p>Floodplains reduce the loading of nutrients and sediment to surface waters and the Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, actions that restore agricultural or developed land back to natural land cover reduces nutrient loading because those lands are no longer excessive sources of nutrients. Further, actions that reconnect rivers to floodplains can actually remove nutrients in the water, because floodplains naturally function as filters to accumulate sediment and to cycle excess nutrients.</p> 
		<p>This assessment shows the potential for floodplains to reduce loading of Nitrate-nitrogen to help you identify opportunities for floodplain projects that could mitigate impacts on drinking water and help reduce the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> 
		<p>Floodplains reduce nitrogen most effectively when there are both high loading rates of nitrogen loading and favorable conditions for in-stream denitrification. Therefore, we mapped high-loading source watersheds (HUC-10 and HUC-12) and we used soils data to identify areas with high organic matter most likely to support higher rates of denitrification. NOTE: actual denitrification is highly variable depending on inundation frequency, depth, duration, temperature and other conditions. This mapping only identifies areas that on average would be expected to provide greater in-stream nutrient reduction.
</p>
		<h4>Flood Related Benefits</h4>
		<p>Floodplain conservation and restoration can reduce flood risk by: 1) avoiding development or moving valuable assets out of harm’s way, and by 2) storing and conveying flood waters to reduce flood stage at other points upstream and downstream in the floodplain. Here, we incorporate two sets of data to provide information about the potential for floodplain projects to contribute to risk reduction. First, we used a spatial analytic approach to assess the potential of floodplain areas behind levees to store and convey floodwaters if these areas were to be reconnected to the river. Although we do not quantify the potential water volume stored or stage reduction achieved, this assessment ranks larger floodplain areas with greater storage capacity as have a higher potential flood reduction benefit. Second, we used FEMA’s HAZUS model to quantify estimated flood damages to structures and to agriculture in both the 1% and the 20% floodplain footprints.</p>
		<h4>Habitat and Biodiversity Benefits</h4>
		<p>Floodplains are ecologically productive ecosystems that provide important habitat for a broad diversity of terrestrial and aquatic species. Although a variety of information could be used to address the potential habitat value of floodplain areas, we have incorporated two simple data sets in this initial tool. The first data set depicts the bottomland forest restoration priorities identified by the Upper Mississippi River Forest Partnership. The second data set uses the USGS Gap Analysis Program data to identify floodplains likely to provide habitat for either 1 or 2 floodplain-dependent bird species. </p>

Therefore, we mapped high-loading source watersheds (HUC-10 and HUC-12) and we used soils data to identify areas with high organic matter most likely to support higher rates of denitrification. NOTE: actual denitrification is highly variable depending on inundation frequency, depth, duration, temperature and other conditions. This mapping only identifies areas that on average would be expected to provide greater in-stream nutrient reduction.

		<h4>Flood Related Benefits</h4>
		<p>Floodplain conservation and restoration can reduce flood risk by: 1) avoiding development or moving valuable assets out of harm’s way, and by 2) storing and conveying flood waters to reduce flood stage at other points upstream and downstream in the floodplain. Here, we incorporate two sets of data to provide information about the potential for floodplain projects to contribute to risk reduction. First, we used a spatial analytic approach to assess the potential of floodplain areas behind levees to store and convey floodwaters if these areas were to be reconnected to the river. Although we do not quantify the potential water volume stored or stage reduction achieved, this assessment ranks larger floodplain areas with greater storage capacity as have a higher potential flood reduction benefit. Second, we used FEMA’s HAZUS model to quantify estimated flood damages to structures and to agriculture in both the 1% and the 20% floodplain footprints.</p>
		<h4>Habitat and Biodiversity Benefits</h4>
		<p>Floodplains are ecologically productive ecosystems that provide important habitat for a broad diversity of terrestrial and aquatic species. Although a variety of information could be used to address the potential habitat value of floodplain areas, we have incorporated two simple data sets in this initial tool. The first data set depicts the bottomland forest restoration priorities identified by the Upper Mississippi River Forest Partnership. The second data set uses the USGS Gap Analysis Program data to identify floodplains likely to provide habitat for either 1 or 2 floodplain-dependent bird species.</p>
